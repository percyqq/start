Could not get any response
  There was an error connecting to http://localhost:36603/scm-wms/innerApi/scm/wms/ext/commercial/businessHour.
  Why this might have happened:
    The server couldn't send a response:
    Ensure that the backend is working properly
    Self-signed SSL certificates are being blocked:
    Fix this by turning off 'SSL certificate verification' in Settings > General
    Proxy configured incorrectly
    Ensure that proxy is configured correctly in Settings > Proxy
    Request timeout:
    Change request timeout in Settings > General
